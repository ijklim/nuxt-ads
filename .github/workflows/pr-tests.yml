  # DESIGN PATTERN: Sequential Quality Check
  # By combining Unit and E2E tests into a single job, we eliminate the need to
  # re-run Checkout, Node setup, and pnpm install. This also allows us to use
  # the build output directly without the overhead of uploading/downloading artifacts.

      # --- SHARED SETUP (Runs once per workflow) ---

      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v6

      - name: Setup pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
        with:
          version: 10

          node-version: 22
          # Enables built-in dependency caching for pnpm using pnpm-lock.yaml.
          # This speeds up installs across workflow runs, but `pnpm install`
          # is still required to link dependencies for the current job.
          cache: pnpm

      # Cache for pnpm is handled by setup-node (cache: pnpm), so no extra actions/cache needed.

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile

      # --- VALIDATION PHASE ---

      - name: Run unit tests

      # Build once and reuse for E2E
      - name: Build application
        run: pnpm build

      # --- E2E PHASE (Reuses existing environment) ---

      - name: Install Playwright browsers
        run: pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps

      - name: Run E2E tests
        run: pnpm test:e2e
